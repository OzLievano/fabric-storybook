# MuiDialog

A MuiDialog inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

A Dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.
