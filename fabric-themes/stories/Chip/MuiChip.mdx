# MuiChip

A MuiChip are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.

MuiChip allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

While included here as a standalone component, the most common use will be in some form of input, so some of the behavior demonstrated here is not shown in context.
