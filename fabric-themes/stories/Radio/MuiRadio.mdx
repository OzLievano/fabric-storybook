# MuiRadio

A MuiRadio allow the user to select one or more items from a set.
Checkboxes can be used to turn an option on or off.

If you have multiple options appearing in a list, you can preserve space by using checkboxes instead of on/off switches. If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off switch instead
